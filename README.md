**Sitefinity Power Tools** is a set of tools for Sitefinity that allow developers to implement advanced scenarios, that are either not possible or not obvious enough in the core product. Some of these tools will eventually make their way to the core product, some on the other hand will only be available through the Power Tools project.

Sitefinity Power Tools is free and open source project. The code can be used in any way you prefer and it is to be used as-is. Sitefinity Power Tools can be used with all editions of Sitefinity, however, it is possible that some of the tools will be usable only with certain editions (e.g. should there be a tool that enhances e-mail campaigns, that tool will be usable only with edition that comes with e-mail campaigns).

## Installation

The simplest way to install Sitefinity Power Tools is through a NuGet package. 

> **Install-Package SitefinityPowerTools**

## Support

Sitefinity Power Tools project is not supported through Sitefinity official support (tickets, forums etc.). Any issues you encounter you can submit here - on [GitHub](http://www.github.com). Questions can also be asked on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), where we will, together with the community, answer those. 

Finally, Sitefinity Power Tools project is completely open source, so it should be pretty straightforward to clone the repository and examine the code.
